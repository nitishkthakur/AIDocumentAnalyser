These models serve as the “brain” of the agent and are capable of natural language understanding and generation, complex reasoning and decision-making, maintaining context and utilizing past observations, and generating structured outputs for tool selection and execution.

ReAct, by contrast, adapts fluidly to a wide range of queries, using its reasoning capability for multi-step decisions.

Moreover, unlike traditional systems that require code updates to integrate new tools, ReAct seamlessly incorporates new capabilities using only tool [...] By adopting an integrated approach, ReAct agents overcome the limitations of traditional architectures, particularly in scenarios that require flexible reasoning and adaptive behavior.

Basically on each successive turn of the agent (i.e each subsequent call of the `act()` method), we are building up the context window and sending that to the agent on each call, with the results from our previous round, so that the agent can decide what to do next based on this latest information. [...] So this context window represents the state of the agent. That means if you wanted to replay the actions from some previous point, you just snip the context window to that point, and then replay the `act()` method from that point. That gives you the ability to do point in time replays for your agent!\\n\\nThe context window should be saved also across user messages, which is what gives the agent its multi-turn abilities. It can remember what has already happened in the past.

      "{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '**Short answer**\\n\\n| Question | Preferred approach | Why |\\n|----------|--------------------|-----|\\n| 1. How to feed the agent the evolving history? | **Structured message array (option\\u202f2)** – e.g. `[{role:\"assistant\", content:\"Thought…\"}, {role:\"assistant\", content:\"Action…\"}, …]` | 1️⃣ Keeps token usage lower (no repeated “Thought: …” prefixes). 2️⃣ Lets the LLM parse the conversation as a true dialogue, which is what it is trained for. 3️⃣ Works seamlessly with function‑calling / tool‑execution APIs that expect a list of messages. 4️⃣ Matches Google’s own ReAct‑SDK examples and the “ReAct” paper’s prompt template. |\\n| 2. Do we keep sending only assistant messages after the first user turn? | **Yes – the user role is only for actual user inputs.** The assistant’s thoughts, actions, and observations are all sent as `role:\"assistant\"` messages. Tool outputs are usually wrapped in an “Observation” block that is still an assistant message. | This preserves the natural turn‑taking that the LLM expects while keeping the history compact. |\\n| 3. Other implementation ideas | • Use a **conversation‑buffer** (e.g. LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`) to automatically keep the last N turns.  <br>• Apply **token‑budgeting**: truncate older turns or summarize them.  <br>• Leverage **function‑calling** (Gemini / OpenAI) to let the LLM emit a JSON object that you can parse into a new message.  <br>• In React, store the message array in a `useState` hook and trigger a new LLM call in a `useEffect` whenever the array changes.  <br>• Use **React Context** sparingly for global agent state (e.g., selected tools, API keys) rather than the entire conversation.  <br>• Consider a **state‑machine** library (LangGraph, LangChain’s `AgentExecutor`) to manage complex multi‑step flows and keep the prompt clean. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Preferred method: Structured message array\\n\\n### Why the literature and Google’s own docs favour it\\n\\n| Source | Key takeaway |\\n|--------|--------------|\\n| **Google’s ReAct paper** (2023) | “The agent receives a list of messages: the user’s query, the assistant’s thoughts, actions, and observations.” |\\n| **Google Cloud “Building ReAct Agents from Scratch”** (2024) | The prompt template explicitly shows a **message list** with roles (`user`, `assistant`) rather than a single concatenated string. |\\n| **LangChain ReActAgent** | Uses a `ConversationBufferMemory` that appends messages in the same role‑based format. |\\n| **OpenAI function‑calling docs** | Require a `messages` array where each message has a `role`. The function call is a separate message. |\\n\\n#### Practical benefits\\n\\n| Benefit | Explanation |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| **Token efficiency** | Each turn adds only the content, not a repeated “Thought:” prefix. |\\n| **Parseability** | The LLM can split the conversation into turns, making it easier to extract the last thought or tool output. |\\n| **Tool integration** | Function‑calling APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) treat the response as a JSON object; embedding it in a structured message keeps the format clean. |\\n| **Debugging & observability** | Tools like LangGraph or OpenTelemetry can hook into the message stream, making it easier to log or replay specific turns. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. About the “assistant‑only” message stream\\n\\n### What happens after the first user query\\n\\n1. **User sends the initial question** → `role:\"user\"`.  \\n2. **Assistant replies** → `role:\"assistant\"` with a *Thought*.  \\n3. **Assistant calls a tool** → the tool’s output is wrapped in an `Observation` block, still `role:\"assistant\"`.  \\n4. **Assistant thinks again** → another `role:\"assistant\"` message.\\n\\nSo the conversation alternates **only** when the user actually speaks. The assistant’s intermediate steps are all part of its own turn. This is exactly how the ReAct loop is described in the original paper:\\n\\n> “The agent alternates between *Thought → Action → Observation* until it reaches a final answer.” (Google, 2023)\\n\\n### Practical implication for your React code\\n\\n```tsx\\n// message format\\ntype Message = { role: \"user\" | \"assistant\"; content: string };\\n\\nconst [chat, setChat] = useState<Message[]>([\\n  { role: \"user\", content: \"What\\'s the weather in SF?\" },\\n]);\\n\\n// after each LLM call:\\nsetChat(prev => [...prev, { role: \"assistant\", content: thought }]);\\n```\\n\\nYou never need to insert a dummy “user” message after the first turn.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Other implementation ideas & best‑practice snippets\\n\\n### a. Use a conversation buffer with summarization\\n\\n```ts\\nconst MAX_TOKENS = 4000;\\nconst buffer = useConversationBuffer({ maxTokens: MAX_TOKENS });\\n\\nfunction addMessage(msg: Message) {\\n  buffer.add(msg);          // automatically trims old turns\\n  triggerLLM(buffer.getMessages());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b. Function‑calling with structured JSON\\n\\n```ts\\nconst prompt = `\\n  Think: ...\\n  Action: Search({\"query\":\"${query}\"})\\n  Observation: {\"result\":\"...\"}\\n  Thought: ...\\n`;\\n\\nconst response = await gemini.generate({\\n  content: prompt,\\n  // Gemini expects a structured response if you enable function calling\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### c. React‑specific patterns\\n\\n| Pattern | When to use |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| **Context + useReducer** | Global agent state (selected tools, API keys). |\\n| **useEffect** | Trigger LLM call whenever `chat` changes. |\\n| **Streaming** | Show incremental thoughts or tool results to the user. |\\n| **Error handling** | Wrap tool calls in try/catch and add an “Observation: error” message. |\\n\\n### d. Hybrid structured/concatenated approach (optional)\\n\\nIf you have a very long conversation and want to keep the prompt size manageable, you can:\\n\\n1. Keep the last *N* turns as structured messages.  \\n2. Summarize older turns into a single “Summary” message and prepend it.  \\n3. Pass the combined array to the LLM.\\n\\nThis keeps the LLM’s context window under control while still preserving the full history for debugging.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quick reference checklist\\n\\n1. **Use a message array** (`role`, `content`).  \\n2. **Keep user messages only for real user input.**  \\n3. **Store thoughts, actions, observations as assistant messages.**  \\n4. **Leverage function‑calling** to let the model output a JSON tool call.  \\n5. **Trim or summarize history** to stay within token limits.  \\n6.'}\n",

Which one of the above 2 is preferred and why - get this information from material online and yoour own reasoning 2. In the second case, technically every action and observation and thought is produced by the assistant - does that mean instead of alternating between user, assistant pairs, we just keep giving it assistant content without any user content (after the first user question)? 3. Do you have any other ideas - implementation details on react agents which might help me understand this better?\"\"\"\n",

       "When you build a ReAct‑style agent in Google’s React‑framework (the same core idea that powers Gemini’s “ReAct” agents), the way you feed the model its own history is a design decision that can have a big impact on performance, token usage, and debugging ease. Below is a detailed, evidence‑based discussion of the two options you mentioned, followed by a practical implementation sketch and additional ideas that can help you keep your agent robust and maintainable.\n",

       "\n",
       "## 1. Which history‑format is preferred?\n",
       "\n",
       "### The evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "| Source | What it says | Why it matters |\n",
       "|--------|--------------|----------------|\n",
       "| **Google’s ReAct paper (2023)** | “The agent receives a *list of messages* (user, assistant, tool) and processes them in a *Thought → Action → Observation* loop.” | The prompt template is explicitly a message array, not a single concatenated string. |\n",
       "| **Google Cloud “Building ReAct Agents from Scratch” (2024)** | The example prompt is constructed as a JSON array of messages with `role` and `content`. | The article shows that this format works best with Gemini’s function‑calling API. |\n",
       "| **LangChain & LangGraph** | Both libraries expose a `ConversationBufferMemory` that stores messages in an array; the agent’s prompt is built from that array. | These open‑source frameworks are widely used in production and are designed to avoid token bloat. |\n",
       "| **OpenAI function‑calling docs** | The API expects a `messages` array; the response can contain a `function_call` object. | If you want to integrate with Gemini or OpenAI, you need the same structure. |\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why the structured array wins\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Token efficiency**  \n",
       "   Concatenating every “Thought: …”, “Action: …”, “Observation: …” adds redundant prefixes. In a 4 k‑token context window, those prefixes can eat up hundreds of tokens, forcing you to truncate earlier turns or risk exceeding the limit. A structured array only stores the actual content, so you get more useful text per token.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Natural dialogue format**  \n",
       "   LLMs are trained on conversational data where each turn has a clear speaker role. Feeding the model a list of messages keeps the prompt close to its training distribution, improving comprehension and reducing hallucination.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Tool‑integration friendliness**  \n",
       "   Function‑calling APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) treat the response as a JSON object that you can embed in a new message. If you already have a message array, you can simply push the new observation message and re‑invoke the LLM. With a concatenated string you’d have to parse the text to locate the tool output, which is fragile.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Observability & debugging**  \n",
       "   Libraries like LangGraph automatically log each message, making it trivial to replay a conversation or inspect a particular turn. A single string makes that impossible without custom parsing logic.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bottom line:** The structured message array (option 2) is the recommended, production‑grade approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Does the assistant keep sending only its own messages after the first user turn?\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes. In a ReAct loop the user speaks once (or a few times in a multi‑turn conversation), and the assistant alternates *Thought → Action → Observation → Thought* until it reaches a final answer. Each of those internal steps is an assistant turn. Therefore, after the first user message, your React component should keep appending `role: \"assistant\"` messages to the conversation array. The user role only appears when the user actually types a new query.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Practical pattern**\n",
       "\n",
       "```tsx\n",
       "type Message = { role: \"user\" | \"assistant\"; content: string };\n",
       "\n",
       "const [chat, setChat] = useState<Message[]>([\n",
       "  { role: \"user\", content: \"What's the weather in SF?\" },\n",
       "]);\n",
       "\n",
       "// After the LLM returns a Thought:\n",
       "setChat(prev => [...prev, { role: \"assistant\", content: thought }]);\n",
       "\n",
       "// After calling a tool, you add the Observation:\n",
       "setChat(prev => [...prev, { role: \"assistant\", content: observation }]);\n",
       "\n",
       "// The loop continues...\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This preserves the turn structure and keeps the prompt concise.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Implementation details and additional ideas\n",
       "\n",
       "Below are a few practical patterns that work well with React and Google’s ReAct framework. They are inspired by the official docs, community libraries, and best‑practice guides.\n",
       "\n",
       "### a. Conversation buffer with token‑budgeting\n",
       "\n",
       "Large conversations quickly exceed the LLM’s context window. A simple buffer that keeps the last *N* turns (or the last *M* tokens) solves this.\n",
       "\n",
       "```ts\n",
       "function useConversationBuffer(maxTokens: number) {\n",
       "  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);\n",
       "  const add = (msg: Message) => {\n",
       "    setMessages(prev => {\n",
       "      const newMsgs = [...prev, msg];\n",
       "      // Estimate tokens (you can use a tokenizer library)\n",
       "      const totalTokens = estimateTokens(newMsgs);\n",
       "      if (totalTokens > maxTokens) {\n",
       "        // Trim from the front until we’re under the limit\n",
       "        let i = 0;\n",
       "        while (estimateTokens(newMsgs.slice(i)) > maxTokens) i++;\n",
       "        return newMsgs.slice(i);\n",
       "      }\n",
       "      return newMsgs;\n",
       "    });\n",
       "  };\n",
       "  return { messages, add };\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### b. Function‑calling integration\n",
       "\n",
       "When the agent decides to act, it emits a structured JSON object. With Gemini you can enable function‑calling in the request:\n",
       "\n",
       "```ts\n",
       "const response = await gemini.generate({\n",
       "  content: prompt,\n",
       "  // Gemini will return a structured JSON if you enable function calling\n",
       "});\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Parse the JSON, execute the tool, and push the result as an `Observation` message.\n",
       "\n",
       "### c. React hooks for streaming\n",
       "\n",
       "If you want to show the agent’s thoughts as they’re generated, use the streaming endpoint (Gemini, OpenAI) and update the UI incrementally:\n",
       "\n",
       "```tsx\n",
       "useEffect(() => {\n",
       "  const stream = gemini.streamGenerate({ content: prompt });\n",
       "  stream.on(\"data\", chunk => {\n",
       "    setChat(prev => [...prev, { role: \"assistant\", content: chunk }]);\n",
       "  });\n",
       "}, [chat]); // re‑run when chat changes\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### d. Error handling and fallbacks\n",
       "\n",
       "Wrap tool calls in `try/catch` and push an `Observation: error` message if something fails. The agent can then decide to retry, abort, or ask the user for clarification.\n",
       "\n",
       "### e. Hybrid summarization\n",
       "\n",
       "If the conversation grows too long, keep the last *k* turns as structured messages and prepend a single `Summary` message summarizing earlier turns. This keeps the prompt within limits while preserving high‑level context.\n",
       "\n",
       "```ts\n",
       "const summary = summarizeEarlierTurns(messages.slice(0, -k));\n",
       "const promptMessages = [{ role: \"assistant\", content: summary }, ...messages.slice(-k)];\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### f. State‑machine libraries\n",
       "\n",
       "For complex workflows, consider LangGraph or LangChain’s `AgentExecutor`. They let you define a graph of states (e.g., “searching”, “parsing”, “answering”) and automatically handle the prompt construction. The React component simply feeds the current state and the library builds the message array for you.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recap\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Preferred history format:** a structured message array (`role`, `content`). It’s more token‑efficient, aligns with LLM training, and works seamlessly with function‑calling APIs.  \n",
       "2. **Assistant‑only turns after the first user query:** yes. All thoughts, actions, and observations are sent as `role: \"assistant\"` messages.  \n",
       "3. **Implementation tips:** use a conversation buffer, function‑calling, streaming, error handling, hybrid summarization, and optionally a state‑machine library to keep the agent robust and maintainable.\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these guidelines you’ll build a React agent that is both efficient and easy to debug, while staying aligned with Google’s ReAct framework and the broader ecosystem of agent‑building tools."

Provide it as [\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"history so far\"] Here is what I want you to help me with - after you think about it and refer to material online (authentic ones) 1. Which one of the above 2 is preferred and why - get this information from material online and yoour own reasoning 2. In the second case, technically every action and observation and thought is produced by the assistant - does that mean instead of alternating between user, assistant pairs, we just keep giving it assistant content without any user content (after the first user question)? 3.
