       "| **Sliding‑window memory** | Keeps the context under the token limit while preserving recent turns. | Use a `useState` hook that stores an array of the last N turns. When you append a new turn, `shift()` the oldest one if the array length exceeds `maxTurns`. |\n",
       "| **Structured prompt template** | Ensures the LLM always sees the same schema. | Create a function `buildPrompt(history)` that returns a JSON string with a fixed schema. Pass this to the LLM via the Google Agents API. |\n",
       "| **Tool‑call abstraction** | Decouples the agent from the actual implementation of actions. | In React, maintain a `tools` map (`{name: func}`) and expose it to the LLM via a “tool‑registry” in the prompt. When the agent outputs `Action: <toolName>`, you call the corresponding function. |\n",
       "| **Observation enrichment** | Gives the agent more context (e.g., confidence, timestamps). | After executing an action, wrap the raw output in an object `{role:\"assistant\", content:\"Observation: ...\", metadata:{confidence:0.95, time:Date.now()}}`. |\n",
       "| **Token‑budget estimator** | Prevents hitting the LLM limit. | Use a helper that estimates token usage (`tiktoken` or `gpt-3.5-turbo` tokenizer). If the estimated tokens exceed the limit, truncate older turns or summarise them. |\n",
       "| **React‑specific UI** | Makes it easier to debug and visualise the agent’s internal state. | Render the `history` array as a chat UI where each turn is a bubble. Highlight the current *Thought* or *Action*. |\n",
       "| **Persist history in localStorage** | Allows the agent to “remember” across page reloads. | On each turn, `localStorage.setItem('agentHistory', JSON.stringify(history))`. On mount, load it back. |\n",
       "| **Server‑side execution of actions** | Keeps the client lightweight and secure. | When the agent outputs an `Action`, send a request to a backend (Node/Express, Firebase Cloud Functions) that performs the tool call and returns the observation. |\n",

Your end goal is to write a comprehensive answer to all of the user's questions.\\n\\n**Here is some additional context: It is September 2025 today. **\\n\\n\\n### Here are the instructions you must always follow:\\n1. Answer the question asked  as best you can by generating thoughts, tool calls (actions) and observations. First generate a thought and a tool call if required. You can call multiple tools at once.\\n2. You should look at the thoughts, question, actions(tool calls) that happened so far\\n3. Very important: **Reflect on what you have done. Identify if something additional needs to be done to answer the full user question. If yes, do it. **Constantly check if you need to do something more or call more tools, etc at every step** - you must do this at every step\\n4. Very important: At any point, if you think you have enough information to answer the original user question, your thought must be \\\"Now I know the final answer\\\" and then generate the final answer enclosed in <final_answer> ... </final_answer> tags\\n5. Your End objective is to answer all of the user's questions accurately using up to date information comprehensively and to write the final_answer enclosed in <final_answer> ... </final_answer> tags. Constantly check if you need to do something more or call more tools, etc at every step\\n6. At every step, look back and check if you have enough information to answer all parts of the user's question. If yes, then write the final answer in <final_answer> ... </final_answer> tags. If not, think about what else you need to do to answer the full user question and do it.\\n\\n\\n### You have access to the following tools:\\n1. Web Search Tool - use this when looking for new information or latest information on something. If looking for any info in 2025 use this tool. Use this whenever you are unsure. For example, when the user asks for a new location, prices, or other things which could change over time. Use it if the user asks you to.\\n2. Calculator - Use this whenever you need to do mathematical calculations - like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, square roots, powers, logarithms, trigonometric functions etc. When using this, use only an expression with a maximum of 2 variables. For more than that, just evaluate the expression with a higher preceedence\\n3. get_time - use this to get the current time\\n\\n\\n\\n### Rules\\n1. Refrain the need to ask the user for more information. If you dont have enough information, assume the user wants a comprehensive answer.\\n2. If you are not sure, use the web search tool\\n3. If the user has a multi part question requiring multiple tool calls, call as many tools as required at any step\\n4. Reflect on what you have done. Identify if something additional needs to be done to answer the full user question. If yes, do it. \\n\\n\",\n",

    "1. Answer the question asked  as best you can by generating thoughts, tool calls (actions) and observations. First generate a thought and a tool call if required. You can call multiple tools at once.\n",

Provide it as [\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"history so far\"] Here is what I want you to help me with - after you think about it and refer to material online (authentic ones) 1. Which one of the above 2 is preferred and why - get this information from material online and yoour own reasoning 2. In the second case, technically every action and observation and thought is produced by the assistant - does that mean instead of alternating between user, assistant pairs, we just keep giving it assistant content without any user content (after the first user question)? 3.
