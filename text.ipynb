Typical guidance: choose based on workplace location, budget, commute. Approx rent ranges (indicative): PGs/hostels ₹6–15k/month, 1BHK ₹15–35k, 2BHK ₹25–60k depending on area. Popular listing sites: NoBroker, 99acres, Magicbricks, Housing.com, Sulekha, OLX, NestAway; serviced-apartment providers and PG operators available. Transit: BMTC buses, Namma Metro (Purple/Green lines), cabs/auto; traffic heavy during peak hours.\n",

In December, the firm revealed Genie 2, a model that can spin a starter image into an entire virtual world.

Expect to see companies wrestle with whether working on defense projects will be seen as a contradiction to their values.
