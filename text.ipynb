      "\n",
      "- Koramangala: Popular with young professionals, vibrant dining/entertainment, well‚Äëconnected to Hosur Road and Koramangala blocks. Typical rents: 1BHK ‚Çπ20k‚Äì40k, 2BHK ‚Çπ30k‚Äì70k; premium 3BHKs much higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Indiranagar: Upscale, nightlife, cafes, good metro access (Purple Line). Rents similar to Koramangala or higher for prime streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- HSR Layout: Planned residential area, quieter than Koramangala/Indiranagar, good for families and professionals working in SE Bengaluru. 1BHK ‚Çπ15k‚Äì35k.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Whitefield: Major IT hub (ITPL) ‚Äî ideal if you work in East Bangalore. Newer apartment complexes and malls; 1BHK ‚Çπ20k‚Äì35k, 2‚Äì3BHK higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Electronic City: Best if your office is in Electronic City ‚Äî lower rents, extensive tech parks, but longer travel to central areas.\n",

      "- Jayanagar / J P Nagar / Banashankari: South Bangalore, family‚Äëfriendly, established schools/hospitals; moderate rents.\n",

      "- BTM Layout / Sarjapur Road / Bellandur: Good for IT commuters (Outer Ring Road, ORR); traffic can be heavy but many apartment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips when moving from Chennai:\n",
      "- Choose area by workplace commute (Bengaluru traffic is heavy). Prefer living within 30‚Äì45 min of your office.\n",
      "- If you value nightlife/cafes, pick Koramangala or Indiranagar; for quieter family life choose HSR, Jayanagar or J P Nagar.\n",
      "- Check metro connectivity if you prefer public transit (Purple and upcoming lines). East/SE suburbs have improving connectivity but still rely on road travel.\n",
      "- Rental process: expect 10 months‚Äô rent as deposit in some areas; verify paperwork and amenities; use NoBroker, MagicBricks, 99acres, or local agents for listings.\n",
      "- Budget ranges (approximate, 2025): 1BHK ‚Çπ15k‚Äì35k; 2BHK ‚Çπ25k‚Äì60k; 3BHK ‚Çπ40k‚Äì1.5L (depends on locality and furnishing).\n",

      "Recommended neighborhoods (2025):\n",
      "\n",
      "- Koramangala: Popular with young professionals, vibrant dining/entertainment, well‚Äëconnected to Hosur Road and Koramangala blocks. Typical rents: 1BHK ‚Çπ20k‚Äì40k, 2BHK ‚Çπ30k‚Äì70k; premium 3BHKs much higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Indiranagar: Upscale, nightlife, cafes, good metro access (Purple Line). Rents similar to Koramangala or higher for prime streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- HSR Layout: Planned residential area, quieter than Koramangala/Indiranagar, good for families and professionals working in SE Bengaluru. 1BHK ‚Çπ15k‚Äì35k.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Whitefield: Major IT hub (ITPL) ‚Äî ideal if you work in East Bangalore. Newer apartment complexes and malls; 1BHK ‚Çπ20k‚Äì35k, 2‚Äì3BHK higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Electronic City: Best if your office is in Electronic City ‚Äî lower rents, extensive tech parks, but longer travel to central areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Jayanagar / J P Nagar / Banashankari: South Bangalore, family‚Äëfriendly, established schools/hospitals; moderate rents.\n",
      "\n",
      "- BTM Layout / Sarjapur Road / Bellandur: Good for IT commuters (Outer Ring Road, ORR); traffic can be heavy but many apartment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips when moving from Chennai:\n",
      "- Choose area by workplace commute (Bengaluru traffic is heavy). Prefer living within 30‚Äì45 min of your office.\n",
      "- If you value nightlife/cafes, pick Koramangala or Indiranagar; for quieter family life choose HSR, Jayanagar or J P Nagar.\n",
      "- Check metro connectivity if you prefer public transit (Purple and upcoming lines). East/SE suburbs have improving connectivity but still rely on road travel.\n",
      "- Rental process: expect 10 months‚Äô rent as deposit in some areas; verify paperwork and amenities; use NoBroker, MagicBricks, 99acres, or local agents for listings.\n",
      "- Budget ranges (approximate, 2025): 1BHK ‚Çπ15k‚Äì35k; 2BHK ‚Çπ25k‚Äì60k; 3BHK ‚Çπ40k‚Äì1.5L (depends on locality and furnishing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next steps I can help with:\n",
      "- Shortlist areas given your office location, budget and family size.\n",
      "- Pull current listings for your preferred neighborhood(s).\n",
